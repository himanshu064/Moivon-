      "NEW YORK — New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing former president Donald Trump, three of his grown children and executives at his company of flagrantly manipulating property valuations to deceive lenders, insurance brokers and tax authorities into giving them better rates on bank loans and insurance policies and to reduce their tax liability.\r\n\r\nThe 222-page civil complaint asks the New York Supreme Court to bar Trump, as well as Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump, from serving as executives at any company in New York, and to bar the Trump Organization from acquiring any commercial real estate or receiving loans from any New York-registered financial institution for five years.\r\n\r\nIt seeks to recover more than $250 million in what James’s office says are ill-gotten gains received through the alleged deceptive practices. While the lawsuit itself is not a criminal prosecution, James (D) said she has referred possible violations of federal law to the Justice Department and the IRS.\r\n\r\nTrump lawyer Alina Habba dismissed the allegations as politically motivated, saying in a statement that the attorney general’s claims are “meritless.”",

      "A Conversation with Camille Norment, Nina Sun Eidsheim, and Stephon Alexander",
    description:
      "On the occasion of her exhibition Plexus at Dia Chelsea, New York, artist Camille Norment will be joined in conversation by physicist and musician Stephon Alexander and by musicologist and vocalist Nina Sun Eidsheim. They will address the artist’s work in the context of vibration and the metaphysics of sound.\r\n\r\nStephon Alexander is a physicist and musician who works between theoretical physics and jazz music. A specialist in the field of string cosmology, Alexander is professor of physics at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. In 2001 he co-invented the model of inflation based on higher-dimensional hypersurfaces in string theory called D-branes. Alexander is the author of The Jazz of Physics: The Secret Link Between Music and the Structure of the Universe (2016) and Fear of a Black Universe: An Outsider’s Guide to the Future of Physics (2021).\r\n\r\nNina Sun Eidsheim is professor of musicology at the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music and founder and director of the UCLA Practice-based Experimental Epistemology (PEER) Lab. She is the author of Sensing Sound: Singing and Listening as Vibrational Practice (2015) and The Race of Sound: Listening, Timbre, and Vocality in African American Music (2019), and co-editor of the Oxford Handbook of Voice Studies (2019) and the Refiguring American Music book series for Duke University Press. She received a BA from Agder Music Conservatory, Kristiansand, Norway; an MFA from the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), Santa Clarita; and a PhD in musicology from the University of California, San Diego. Currently she is working on a book collaboration with Wadada Leo Smith and a multimodel project that maps networks of metaphors structuring musical discourse and practice.\r\n\r\nCamille Norment was born in Silver Spring, Maryland, in 1970. She received a BA in comparative literature and art history from the University of Michigan in 1992, and an MFA and an MA in Interactive Telecommunications from New York University in 1994 and 1998. She attended the Whitney Independent Study Program from 1994–95. Informed by the sonic, Norment’s practice spans drawing, installation, performance, sculpture, sound, and video. Her work has recently been the subject of solo exhibitions at Oslo Kunstforening, Norway; the Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts, University of Chicago; and Temple Bar Gallery + Studios, Dublin. Several public works by Norment are permanently installed in Norway and Italy. She has recently performed at institutions including the Munch Museum, Oslo (2021); the Renaissance Society, University of Chicago (with Hamid Drake, 2019); and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (with Craig Taborn, 2019). Her albums include Toll (2011) and the soundtrack and special edition LP for the film The Haunted (2017/20). Norment represented Norway in the 2015 Venice Biennale and has since participated in the biennials of Kochi-Muziris, India (2016); Montreal, Canada (2016); Lyon, France (2017); and Thailand (2018). She is prorector of research at the Kunsthøgskolen i Oslo (Oslo National Academy of the Arts). She lives in Oslo.",
